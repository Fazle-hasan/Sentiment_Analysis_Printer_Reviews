0,⚡ Pushpendra Singh Patel ⚡,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only MFP you need unless colour prints are required | Review | Full network capability is plus here,"I was looking for good quality MFP in the 10k range and came across this model. HP name and its features were eye-catcher and I was able to finalize it soon.I am using this MFP for more than a year and so far had no issues, be it printing or scanning or copier. P.S. I use only genuine HP toner in it, so it’s quite a deal.HP 126nw, mark this nw in its name as it makes it super useful, giving it network capability in terms of LAN/Wi-Fi for both printing and scanning. This is really useful as you can keep it anywhere and print from virtually any location without any cable connected (other than power cable).Setting it up, in general, is a breeze while the Wi-Fi scan is a bit complicated. I will list the steps to make it easy for you.FYI, I got it from Cambium Retail seller.•••••••••••••••INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••1. Printer2. Paper stack tray3. Print collection tray4.

A wonderful multifunction device with laser printing.2. Detailed control panel with 2 line LCD text display3. Good print & scan speed/resolution. Print (up to 20ppm, 1200 dpi) & scan (up to 7ppm b/w, 5ppm colour, 1200 dpi).4. Multiple connectivity options for print/scan. USB/LAN/Wi-Fi.5. Set up anywhere, thanks to its Wi-Fi connectivity. Just a power source required.5. Print using smartphone directly via Wi-Di i.e. Smartphone → Printer6. Print using smartphone via network i.e. Smartphone → Router → Printer (Download HP print service plugin from app store)8. It can be used as a standalone photocopy machine using the control panel with an extra double side photocopy feature for ID cards etc.9. All photocopy related controls are available on panel, like one-touch photocopy button, no of copies, light-dark with 11 steps, reduce/enlarge, optimization, paper setting, etc10. Tiltable control panel for easy access.11. The good thing with a laser printer is that you don’t have to worry about drying ink or print head. I had 2 heads replaced in the earlier inkjet printer. So even if off for a month, laser one works instantly with the same good quality.••••••••CONS••••••••1. Scan quality is not crisp. On full zoom, I find it slightly blurry. But in regular day to day scanning tasks, you won’t even notice it. So not a big deal.2. No backlit LCD and it’s a pain to operate it without backlight unless you tilt it.3. No ADF for scanning, so you need feed in every single page to be scanned separately. (But you can’t get everything in this range)4. Initial warm-up time (power on to ready) is quite large, ~40 sec.•••••••••••••FEATURES•••••••••••••-Extensive control panel on the front-Web panel/local network page accessible via IP address.

Remove various seals from around MFP.2. Take out the cartridge from MFP and remove the orange clip & pull orange tab to remove the seal. Reinstall it.3. Attach power cable.4. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.5. Follow on-screen instructions for the desired setup.- USB based- Connect through network- First-time wireless connection•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••CONFIGURING IT FOR WIRELESS SCANNING & PRINTING BOTH•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶ WITHOUT WPSThe initial setup of this MFP directly via 'first-time wireless connection' option, does not enable scan via Wi-Fi. Only printing works. I will take you through steps to enable wireless scanning which is really very handy. It took me a lot of time to figure it out.If already configured on network and you set it up via 2nd option, then scanning will work.1. Power on MFP. Do not connect it via LAN cable or USB cable for now.2. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.3. Choose USB based setup. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.4. Again run the installer and now choose the 3rd option, first-time wireless connection. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.5. Now when you run HP scan utility, it will be able to communicate to MFP via Wi-Fi.6. If you skip step 3 above, it won’t work and give communication error.▶ WITH WPS1. Power on MFP. USB or LAN cable is not required.2. Press the Wi-Fi button on MFP to start the WPS connection.3. Push the WPS button on your router.4. Let it connect to the router. Once successful, the IP address will be displayed on LCD.5. Now start setup and select 2nd option 'connect through the network'. It will search for the printer on the network.6. Once found, select it and proceed.•••••••••••••••••••FINAL VERDICT•••••••••••••••••••I am using it for more than a year and it never disappointed me in terms of usage, be it printing/scanning/copy task.▶ This device, M126nw is highly suitable for general home usage where you don’t print every day or light to medium office work where you print/scan daily.  You can very well go for it.▶ There used to be another model m126a without network capability. If you can find it, you can save some bucks. But a few bucks more get you a good deal of value proposition with m126nw."

9,Ramachandra K,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"Digital display is very small. There is no light on the display. Calculator display is better than this, if we compare.. I think cartridge quality also not good. Cartridge got empty just in 30 days. Only 800 copies it was printed. Our old hp1018 is printing more than 3000 copies in a single refill."
