Ramachandra K,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"Digital display is very small. There is no light on the display. Calculator display is better than this, if we compare.. I think cartridge quality also not good. Cartridge got empty just in 30 days. Only 800 copies it was printed. Our old hp1018 is printing more than 3000 copies in a single refill."

Jaspreet Singh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good printer with bad printer cartridge,"Over all it is a decent experience using this printer, print quality was good in starting but deteriorated in just 15-20 days of usage, setting up the printer was easy, scanning process is way too slow takes a lot of time to scan pages. If you have to print 25-30 pages per day and scan a lot documents daily this device won't be recommended otherwise it is fine product. Company should focus on providing good quality of printer cartridge as mine got exhausted in just 20 days of usage."
Harisankar koiri,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, Easy to use","Printer is good in terms of ease to use, quality of print also good but scan quality was not so good, processing speed little bit slow and usb cable for connection of Pc to printer was not given also, Price is little bit high as compared to specification."
VIKAS DUGGAL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Multipurpose printer,Multipurpose printer... print speed is good..
Amit kumar singh,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Printer,"The product is good in terms of print quality, installation and operation. Till Today I haven't face any issue regarding printer but the original cartridge which comes with the printer has low page yield than advertised.
I have to change the original cartridge as it stopped working after refilling."
SANJEEV VHAUDHARY,5.0 out of 5 stars,GOOD QUALITY,AMAZING
ajay mittal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best,
Amulya bhatnagar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,nice
Ranajay basu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic packaging,"Very much disappointed by the seller who didnt even pack such costly (to me at least dnt know about seller, he might have billions dollar) device in corrugated box or wrapper. It shows carelessness towards prepaid customers. I was not on sopt otherwise I would have returned the product and ask for refund. When I came to the place and opend the box what found is bottom side on top. Very bad experience so far with Amazon. I will never recommend and even if someone is going to buy from this seller make sure you select Cash on delivery bc once you pay them they will treat your products (basically your money) like wastage. So be careful.
Now let jump straight to the product: Once you set your mind to purchase this model make sure you have good eye sight bc it doesn't have any light on screen which may affect your experience after purchase just like me. I didn't expect letters are such small so it's hard to see. Printing quality is moderate, have better experience with model M1136(very very satisfied, after 7 years and still running like a mad horse) which will save your 3k easily. Configuration of Wireless connection is really headache however somehow managed(you need seperate router), connection with smartphone: Haaaa!! I still wondering how it works, your phone could find the wifi of printer and ask for security password...but here is a twist..there is no password anywhere mentioned. You have to be Sherlock Holmes to find wifi password. Gist: Do not waste your hard earnings and go for Laserjet M1136 if you dnt need wireless printer and spend that extra 3k for poor old beggers or stray/injured animals through funding. BTW money is yours do whatever you want to do.."
Bhargav Patel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Printer can't cannot to network and also USB,"Printer doesn't work properly. Not working wifi aur usb,"
Rohit Saha,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was a office purchase.,The build quality was good. It was really easy to install after following the installation guide & the best part was WiFi/wireless printing.
Deepak Kumar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good wireless printer,"Great thing I feel is wifi printing and scanning. Good printing quality, easy to install, fast printing.
I would like to tell you how to install printer through wireless at home
1. Unbox your product and remove cartridge inserted in the printer
2. Remove paper strip and a plastic cap from cartridge. Insert cartridge into the printer
3. Keep your WiFi switched on and power on the printer. Do not connect printer to computer through usb cable
4. On printer console switch on the WiFi switch. (There will be a WiFi icon on the button)
5. On printer LED display you will see ""searching for WPS"". Your WiFi has WPS switch so switch it on.
6. Printer will be connected through WiFi and an address will be displayed on printer LED.
7. Insert your CD in the computer and do as directed. When it asks for Mode of connection then choose wireless instead of usb cable.
8. Your computer will automatically detect printer then go next.
9. After few minutes your printer will be ready
Any device (mobile, laptop) connected with your wifi can operate your printer."
shyam jivnani,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Excellent ??
Bl@ckp3@rl,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product overall,"Overall good quality ,have searched a lot about a printer with scanner for home usage purpose ,go through various products like intjet ,inktank and laser ,also have personal usage experience for the ink jet printers they are low price initially but the cartridge cost is high and u have to use it regularly otherwise its dried up ,
So m confused between laser black and white or inktank colour ,but after going through various reviews online pushes me to buy laser printer ,black and white and i dont have much requirememt for colour printing ,so initial cost for this printer is some what higher then both other competitors but the maintainance cost is less as said overall ,so finally choose this one ,those who want to use colour printing photos prinitng can go with inktank also its printing cost is lesser then inkjet ,
This is initial review will edit up after some more usage ,till now happy with my product ,as it has wifi connectivity ,also have scanning option ,and moreover easy to installl urself ,
One kore thing want to add on this review for newbies like me u have to install urself no demo will be provided so go through material provided ,and thanks for making my review usefull ,enjoy"
Joshua,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go for it,Working well in office almost a year now using it daily.
Jyothish Babu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Printer with super wireless connectivity,"I purchased this for home and very happy with this. Print quality is okay. What I liked is the wifi connectivity. Once connected using WPS on the router, it gives seamless printing access to all android mobiles, tabs and laptops in the same network. This is apart from the USB connectivity. One can print without connecting to router also - printer can be directly accessed through its wifi host from any device.
However, HP's printer software suit installation took very long time. I think it is packed with so many unnecessary things. Once installed, my desktop and laptop started crashing and slowing down (Windows 10 OS). Issue got solved when I removed everything, retaining only the drivers. Not sure the criteria only with me!"
Sanket,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good versatile printer but difficult to setup and no back-lit display,"Pros
1. Feature packed.
2. 88A can be refilled loads of videos on YouTube.
3. Hp connected we services allows you to print documents from printer by creating an email address for your printer. So any documents send to this xyz@hpeprint.com address will be printed from your printer.
4. Facebook Messenger bot to print docs using Facebook Messenger.
5. WiFi and network printing works great.
6. Tried hp eprint app on android and worked good.
7. Tried WiFi direct printing as well that too worked well from my Android phone.
8. You get detailed reports about the printer configuration which the printer can print for you.
9. Detailed Web ui if you are connected to this using WiFi.

Cons
1. Setup is not friendly for a non technical user.
2. Display has no back light this is not a deal breaker but it's difficult to read even after tilting the display. I kept searching the menu to enable the back light.
3. Installer / driver did not run and install drivers on my windows 8.1 laptop but worked fine on win 7 and win 10 and Mac OSX 10.10 Yosemite.
4. First time WiFi setup using installer did not work on Windows any version I configured WiFi using the WPS button on my router it was quick.

Tip
1. To connect the printer to WiFi network use WPS button to join the network this is the easiest and quick way. Installer method did not work. In the installer it tries to pull WiFi settings from your laptop or pc and it fails every time I tried this.

Toner
No idea on how many pages will I be able to print on the stock toner will update here."
ravi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Working good and easy,Good quality and easy working
Mukund Rajamannar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great once you set it up right,"Connect to it via USB or Wifi Direct and you are able to configure everything using a web browser. You need to enable the Wifi Direct using the panel in front.

The biggest problem comes afterwards from HP itself. They have their own ""Easy Start"" software for the MacOS which is out dated and doesn't work with latest version of MacOS 10.15.7. Moreover, it enables with HP web print service which is not required. My suggestion is not to install any custom HP software for this printer on the MacOS and just use the built-in drivers.

Everything works fine once it is setup and it is surprisingly quick."
rahul,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's a good printer which does what it says,"It's a good printer which does what it says
Giving it 4 star as Pricing is little high, the model I have bought doesn't have wifi."
Andrews Nabam,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product,"Nice product but cartridge cost around 8k which is very much higher
In price ?? ek printer ??? aa jayega 8k main."
ALAMIN SK,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice ??,Nice pic ??
Alok R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good printer for hone and for commercial purpose,It's valuable product for day to day life for home and office
JJR,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product - but bit pricy,"I just bought the product its been 5days...so far good experience. not very sure about the cost per sheet (if someone knows please pin). one negative point is the display you need to switch your mobile torch to see what is displaying. customer support from HP is very real-time and fast (excellent). Amazon delivery is as per agreed time- great work.
did not used the copy and scan yet. will update once I am."
Ranjeet,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful Product saving my time making life easy on the go !!,"I was very sceptical after reading reviews about this printer here. After reading review and fitting in my budget with the wireless feature I wanted, I ordered this. Many people has written about the features and review here. Let me write few amazing features that people seems not explored.

1. This has remote printing feature over email. You need to create email ID (used software in CD and not to download over internet) on their domain hpeprint.com and from anywhere in world just send the printing material as attachment to that email address. Printer will download that over internet and print that. Just like virtual fax, This is an amazing feature for me.

2. Cloud printing that suits me as I receive lot of material for my school going kids and I travel a lot. I simply need to send that document either through email or print using ePrint app.

3. Direct printing feature - you can directly connect printer wifi and print without any router.

4. True Apple Print feature. Can print directly from apple product without router.

5. Through HP connect, you can make setting changes etc in printer remotely over internet from anywhere in the world.

Overall this is helping me a lot in saving time on the go...not only mine but my wife as well as she need to spare time to print what I forward over email. I can simply forward email to printer email ID. Even printer is switch off, this get printer once printer switch on. Printer must be connected to your home/office internet either wifi or lan.

Recently I was out of India on business trip and need some document copy urgently. I called home and ask my kid to put the paper on scanner one by one and I remotely scanned all and all came to my laptop instantly.

There is also secure printing feature...I have not explored that in detail yet.

Wonderful solution for me. Overall excellent product."
King,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best for Home Use,"This is the best printer in 15K range, Whoever thinking of buying printer should go ahead with this one. It is best for normal home use.

However i do like to mention some pros and cons for this printer...

* Pros-
1. It has great print quality.

2. Wi-Fi is hussle free just connect with Android app.

3. Easy Menu buttons i.e Photocopy,Scan,Double-Side Print etc.

*Cons-
1. Scanner is not upto the mark, having price range of 15K should have given some quality scanner.

2. Backlit Issue, Yes there is no backlit on screen provided on menu buttons.

3. Software/Drivers provided by them with the printer might be bit outdated so you will have to manually download the latest version of the software."
Sanjeev pacharne,3.0 out of 5 stars,good,smooth but complicated to install
Vijaykumar jain,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb item totally hassle free printer,"Very easy to install and haselfree for use
Totally satisfied with the same
Worth for money"
Hridyesh,4.0 out of 5 stars,Review After 1 Year,"Writing this after 1 year.
Product is very smooth, no issues.
There is one backlight issue though which can be resolved if you place it under led lamp or something.
Writing this to spread the fact that the cartridge of this laser peinter laster for 12 months wich medium usage.
This is good.!!"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Unable to Scan,"The print function on Wifi was easy to install and works well. The challenge is to get the scanner function on the wireless. I spent over three hours, installing various drivers, HP scanning application and HP printer and scanner doctor but the issue is unresolved. As of now, I can get the document scanned and displayed on the screen but the app does not permit me to save the pdf file on my computer disk. Also, a simple 200 dpi scan took a fairly long time. I also read that there are certain issue in connectivity of this printer when using Windows 10. All this is pretty frustrating. I wonder if someone has solved the wireless scanning function for this printer linked to a windows 10 laptop else I regret having selected this model."
Jahangeer Alam,4.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting Product!!,"Model - M126nw. Professional tip: Always purchase an extra perfect toner with your new printer :)

My Quick Find outs are - stars:

1. Good Toners effectively accessible at just shy of 500 INR on Amazon so no stress over printing cost.

2. WiFi arrangement and remote printing is very simple (by telephone or workstations)

3. Utilizing it as system printer atm (by LAN port in my little office)

4. Print quality is wonderful 5/5 for that

5. Photograph Copy/Xerox are so fine, get befuddled which one is unique in the event that I duplicate (if duplicate b/w)

6. Examining quality is pleasant as well.

Cons:

A few interesting points before purchasing this printer:

1. Incapable to duplicate/examine huge size of papers (legitimate size)

2. No backlight in computerized show screen"
Sushil K Aggarwal,2.0 out of 5 stars,PRB WIFI AND GST NO OF PURCHASER WRONG,not able to run wifi and GST BILLING IS WRONG. TRIED TO CALL HP CONSURMER CARE BUT NOT USEFUL
M P,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good printer but....,Brief review - i bought this model as i wanted wifi based model. But sadly it is difficult to connect each n every time from mobile to printer. Sometimes it doesn't connect and we have to reboot the device. In todays world mostly everyone wants prints from mobile. But it is difficult task for me. We have to waste atleast 10 mins connecting to device. Thats d main issue for me. Rest i feel all printer companies are making good printers. It doesn't matter print per minute and all for me.
Shaddy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good printer with affordable price,Good printer and value for money as I used for 1 week . Setup was easy .
Ved sharma,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good ??,Good ??
Sen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Glad I have bought this printer,"I was looking for laser jet without scanner and to my surprise not many options hence went ahead and bought this. I am glad that I have purchased this. The HP Smart app is simply amazing and with WiFi direct it works like a pro. I now use the scanner more than printer to scan and upload my kids h/w. Only disappointment is I am unable to pair with my WiFi, followed the steps but still doesn’t work. Got similar feedback when I did a google search. Another drawback is very expensive for a b/w printer."
Tinu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,"Just delivered the product yesterday... Installation process i found it difficult..
The setup installation I installed from website since CD setup was showing error.
Normal setup via USB was okay to setup.But I struggled a lot in setting up wifi...Gone through many YouTube videos for the same..Its working good now..

Pros:
Scan, copy,print in one device
Wireless option available.

Cons:
Device little heavy.
Setup installation was difficult.
Slightly pricey than other devices.

Hopefully all should be worth it.
Reducing one star due to setup installation."
Harish Kumar Nellore,4.0 out of 5 stars,Suitable printer for home,"Overall it is a good product and the suggestion is to pay a little more additional better to buy the duplex printer so to avoid the changing the paper when we print for both sdie.
HP is always the best in their products and especially the quality and this product is really value for money and very compact in size and recommended product."
Prabhat,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality one in average priced,I am using this printer in my Office since four months and running good. Print quality is very nice. If would be nice if it prints both sides without manual feed.
Dhiraj,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"Good product from hp.
Meets the need . Wifi printing needs user frendly upgradation."
Keshav_s7,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great printer for the price,"Pros:
Works as expected.
Wireless printing is supported on multiple platforms. Android, IOS and Windows.
The HP smart app is really great.
HP e-print service seems really helpful when not around the printer.

Cons:
Prints, especially the copies can lack contrast. A quick change in contrast settings should fix that immediately.

The display has no back-light. Hard to see if the display isn't close (+- 30cms) to eye-level or when in dimly lit areas."
govindraj,4.0 out of 5 stars,PHONE CORD AND CD MISSING,Both phone cord and CD missing
mrvdas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product,Good product
S. K. GOODWILL DISTRIBUTORS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Printer For Office Use!!!,"1. Easy to install. Just go through the instructions given in the booklet provided to you.
2. Great look and attractive model from HP.
3. Print from any device from anywhere.
4. All in one printer makes your work easy going and hassle-free.
5. WiFi connectivity help you go to wireless printing.
6. Fast printing (only a few seconds)
7. No printing noise
8. Prints smooth like butter.
9. Easy to operate an LCD panel with a clear display.

This printer is suitable for offices only. Don't buy for home use at such a high price. I bought it at NO COST EMI. Thanks to Amazon Pay Later feature."
Altamash,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor software and interface to connect through wifi,Poor software and interface to connect through wifi
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wireless Printing is great. Scan only on Windows via HP Smart!,"HP smart app (Scan feature) works selectively only on windows 10. It doesn't work on android phones even on latest versions. Somehow they are not addressing it. It should be a simple software update fix. If you are looking for a can feature, better off with this model and see if there are other printer models which work seamlessly.

The printing however is great and seamless either from android or windows."
Krishan lather,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good printer for office or home,"Excellent printer, scanner and copier.
But worst part is that whenever your black toner become low and you have to refill drum and powder both and it will never stop showing that message.
Easy to use and install.
Wifi feature is also very useful.
No data cable required if you have any internet facility."
RAJESH AGOLA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb printer,Superb printer.
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,GREATE PRINTER,"I am writing this review after almost 04 months of extensive use with quite satisfaction.
Pros: I) Excellent print quality. ii) Scan/ copy quality is also very good. iii) sound less. Wi-fi is an added advantage. iv) comes with original packing. v) Amazon delivery is very fast, I received it within 1 day.
cons: I) price tag is little higher side ii) display is not LED illuminated, difficult to view without proper lighting condition of the room. iii) Printer cartridge which comes with the printer, does not come with full toner, exhausts very fast. iv) should have come with auto reverse printing in this price tag."
Dharmesh Padhra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic investment,"Using it since a month and working amazing. Moreover, it is a laser printer so even if i print after 2 month, no maintenance is required like inkjet printer. It only prints monochrome but its worth it to buy laserjet printer rather buying inkjet printer and increasing your expenses of maintenance. Amazing product with simplistic and classic looks."
Sunil,4.0 out of 5 stars,Print Quality is Good,"Print Quality is V good, Scan is OK. HP does not support online for installation and other troubleshooting. This is Second printer of HP were i have faced such problem. Or else Printer is V good in this Segment for Office use."
SUKANYA GHOSH,4.0 out of 5 stars,Unsatisfactory Display panel,"The only problem with this printer is the display panel. It is very difficult to see what is written as it is not backlight and you literally have to shine a torch to read what it says. This is made even more frustrating because it has settings etc that can be configured on the printer itself. Other than this obvious design flaw, the printer is great!"
sushil shera,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ok,Outstanding
Tushar Nagda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in class.,"I have used several printers by now and HP has done a commendable job. Laser printers are the best if you're looking for speed. Had several issues with wireless printing. Specially from Laptop. Still figuring it out. Mobile app works flawlessly and printing is fast. Copy and scan are also good. Wi-Fi signal is pretty strong, you can literally print from any corner of your home if you have average size home. I don't think there is any better option than this printer in this price range. Go for it."
Mainak Choudhuri,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good printer, check CDs and invoice","Good printer, connects wirelessly without any problem, though I need to take a printout to get the mac and ip address of the printer, so that I can add it to the routers allowed devices. HP could print the mac address on the side of the printer, as done in many other printers. I have connected the printer exclusively through wifi, but people can use both lan and wifi together, say for a desktop and laptop/mobile.
The box contains two driver CDs for Mac and none for Windows, so buyers beware. The link for the product page in HP's site is [...], where you can get the drivers and manuals, deducted one star for that. Also, check the serial number on the invoice and that on the printer itself, they should match.
Print quality and speed is good. The demo cartridge should print about 550 pages, as the monitoring software says."
Mihir Mondal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good printer,Good product
Robin Singh Yadav,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent printer but I feel like it's overpriced.,"The print quality from this printer is above average.
You can easily setup Wi-Fi on this and can print through your phone or even laptop, although the printing takes some time.
Bought it for 13.4k, which I feel is a bit expensive but the scanning and variety of options compensates that.
Does take some time to start up and start printing, not that fast if you were thinking.
Got around 400-450 pages from the starting cartridge and bought a new one for 800.
The Hp Smart app for phone doesn't work that quite well, faces issues like it couldn't scan or copy from the app, the printing was fine though."
Varkala Marine Palace Pvt Ltd,1.0 out of 5 stars,Toner Faulty,The Print quality was horrible and after a few weeks we realize that the powder is leaking from the drum. Certainly this is not big news for HP and so far no assistance on ground than HP follow up consolation. Have a feeling not to buy online again and pretty sure being cheated / being accused of some wrong doings at the end. Wondering if the New product must be thrown in the dustbin or sell it for some pittance.
Mohammad Zuber,4.0 out of 5 stars,Print quality is good but speed is very slow,"Print quality is best but speed is very slow.
HP 126nw is best"
Kalpit Rathi,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best printer available at this price,"Pros:
1.Amazing print quality (as compared to the hp laser printer that I own - Laserjet 1018)
2.Scanner too is above average
3.Wireless print ability makes it stand out - especially print via smartphone, it also has Airprint support for apple devices
4.Cloud print and dedicated print directly via hp email address (that too free), all together another feather in the cap
5.Wireless LAN access to printer settings is another handy feature
6.Additional features like: Photocopy, ID Card copy, Copy size configuration from printer panel

Cons:
1.No LED backlight for display screen; which makes it difficult to check in low light conditions
2.Dont expect to run it on inverter, you might end up in a deadlock situation as it sucks lot of power - just like any other laser printer

5 Years and still working as new"
Nagaraju Munjuluru,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good perfamenc.,Easy installation
MD SHAKIR PASHA,4.0 out of 5 stars,No comments,"It has mentioned , duplex printing, but in the manual booklet received, it is clearly mentioned that it could not print duplex itself, we have to manual process for duplex printing. This is very disappointed me. Other wise the product is very good"
ashok,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommandble product .,Recommandble product . Easy to install and world class product and recommandble printers o home and office purpose. Premium segment
Abhishek Rathore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Old model but still the best one,"I was looking for a laser printer with WiFi capability and selected this printer based on my budget and its overall reviews on Amazon and external sites.
Delivery:: Delivered in 2 days to the door step, Plastic wrapped not bubble, but handled properly with some minor dents in packaging.
Setup and Driver installation: setup is easy. On MacOS, the system itself has prompted for supporting drivers.
WiFi setup is easy as well. Apps from HP are available to enhance the experience on mobile devices.
Print quality and ease to use: Currently my whole family can connect to the printer using computer or mobile device using wifi. It takes 10-15 seconds first to warm up and can print 15 pages per minute. Quality is good and best performance and quality was observed for the documents in DOC format. Copy function works well and there is a workarround possible to get double sided copy.
Limitations: Not capable to perform double sided print and copy automatically. Limited capacity of the free cartridge.
Suggestions: Kindly use the instructions manual to unwrap the cartridge before using."
Jash,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works fine initially, but need to see the performance in future","I'm writing this review after two months of usage of this product. Print quality is good, works well with Wi-Fi direct. The only problem is u need to change the drum of your cartridge that was supplied with this product after printing a bundle of papers while refilling the cartridge, other than that everything is fine"
Vikash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Printer - For Professional Use,"This Printer is best suitable for the Office purpose who can use Monochrome (Black & White) color printouts.

PROS:
1. Best Print Quality.

2. Faster Printouts.

3. Scanning - Quality is Good.
NOTE: For getting the best scanning quality, we need to use the Software and Adjust the BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST to get the Scanning with High Quality.

PRINTER's DEFAULT SCAN SETTING WILL GIVE YOU THE WORST SCANNINGS. SO, BEFORE SCANNING PLEASE MAKE SURE, YOU HAVE SET THE BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST IN THE HP PRINTER SOFTWARE.

4. Wifi - Connectivity - Best - Tested in Android Device through the App HP Service Plugin.

CONS:
1. Printer's Display doesn't have Back-Light. So it is very difficult to work in a dark environment. At this price range, they would have given the Back-Light for the Display.

2.Unable to Update Printer Software. Whatever the software which comes in CD will be usable. This is the hassle which I faced."
UTTAM KUMAR,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,Excellent product but in addition of this purchase I did not get the free and offer item which was an HP headphone.
YetAnotherGuy,5.0 out of 5 stars,M126nw - Best laser printer with so many features in this price segment,"Model - M126nw. Pro-tip: Always buy an extra compatible toner with your new printer :)
My Quick Find outs are --- pros:
1. Compatible Toners easily available at just under 500 INR on Amazon so no worry about printing cost.
2. WiFi setup and wireless printing is extremely easy (by phone or laptops)
3. Using it as network printer atm (by LAN port in my small office)
4. Print quality is awesome 5/5 for that
5. Photo Copy /Xerox are so fine, get confused which one is original if I copy (if copy b/w)
6. Scanning quality is nice too.

Cons:
Some things to consider before buying this printer:
1. Unable to copy/scan large size of papers (legal size)
2. No back-lit in digital display screen"
Dipankar Nayak,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its VALUE for Money,"Liked the WIFI feature - You can take a print from almost any thing.. A laptop, an iPHONE, an Andriod phone..
It makes life easy....

Disliked - the build quality could have been better. The rubber buttons (which I think, in next 4-5 years) may wear out ..
Overall - The print quality (monochrome) is excellent. The print speed is great and Last but not the least -they delivered me the product in one day...."
Vedant Agarwal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good Printer,"The product is very good. Sound proof print and scan. Wireless facility is perfect.
However, beware of AMAZON tricking you by issuing the bill in a different seller name than from whom you have ordered. HP does not provide warranty on products from all sellers.
Other the product is very good. Though it takes time and some expert knowledge to install the printer and scanner wireless facility and the LCD does not have lights so its really difficult to see at night.
Other wise the product is perfect for wireless and e-printing.
But I am warning you again to check seller name in invoice before taking delivery. I have been waiting for last 5 days. to get it corrected but to no avail."
Anand Swaroop Sharma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Product , best price with few service cons !!","Great printer, I have been using it for a couple of months. Local Wifi connectivity was smooth as desired. It can connect directly with laptop as a wifi device through network router. ( you may not be able to have two printers setup together i.e., one as wifi-direct other as wifi-network). So you have two smooth options to print : USB cable and through Wifi-direct/wifi-network.

HP claims to have e-Print enabled, but it didn't work for me tried to set it up for a couple of hours with HP support on phone , they ultimately sent an engineer on site to do the setup, who was Tech-illiterate from a franchisee and they swiftly the complaint without any followup/check/feedback. So don't expect e-Print to work always. Not all HP online support personnel are knowledgeable, I luckily found one after switching few, who agreed to call me over phone and fixed the setup issues to a great extent. so some support engineers are great depends on who you get. :)

Buy for the great product build, at this price"
Vinod Sharma,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice product,Very nice quality
MANU,4.0 out of 5 stars,Honest review,"I have been buying HP printers for last 15 years. This is my 4th product at home. Happy as always but the value for money is missing. Software are on CD and none of my family members have CD reader in laptops so had to download from internet on each system. Moreover setting up was little difficult, especially wifi printing setup. They did not provide any guide or tutorial for that."
Roshan M,2.0 out of 5 stars,3 year review. PURCHASED in 2015,"THE WORST PRINTER>
I'll keep it short.
PROS:
-Prints at a good speed and good and easy Printing. Get many pages from one Cartridge.
-Good for printing a huge pdf at once.
Cons:
-Wi-Fi range is a line of sight. If Laptop in another room it would take a long time to get the information of data to print.
- Blacks are not deep black, even if it's not on Eco mode.
- I have a dual router at home that is 5Ghz and 2.4 GHz for my internet. So when you using this on wifi, the printer will only connect to the 2ghz one. So you have to disconnect the internet on your device and connect to the Printer wifi and then print.
- Printing on wifi is a SLOW process. The times I needed to print something quick its never been able to just work.

If you using only for USB or cable only then it might be good.
- The scanner has been getting some black staining inside which doesn't reproduce the best quality scans.

In short, this is the last time I am purchasing HP as a printer brand.
The Fact that to print 1 page I have to go through so much, doesn't classify this a friendly printer at all."
pgm,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't print brightly at a after changing cartridge too,One of the worst printer. Brought fr home/off purpose but after a year it started printing lightly changed cartridge and called service person also nothing worked some tech software error complete junk now.
RAM,3.0 out of 5 stars,I don't recommend if looking for a best:Check the reveiw .,"It has been 20 days since I have bought this printer.
Over all print quality is OK .

The quality of the print of colors like blue (light) is very bad in the grey scale ,it is printed very lightly .Not checked with all the colors .

Scan quality is good .

Support from hp is also great .

16k I expect the printer to be better...

Go for a better one .

Or if your print job is frequent,go for a inkjet printer color .

Thank you !

Hope this helps ."

Rohan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality print,Print quality is good. At this price range good printer i must say. All the aspects are good. If that screen is provided with light means would have been even more better. Scan quality felt little low as compared to other HP Scanner.

SOMA SAMPATH KUMAR,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the people who are looking for all in one laser jet printer,It is very tough to install. We tried calling tech support team for installation but none responeded. We got it installed from private source and got paid service.
Hans Raj Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,USED CATRIDGE HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN THE NEW PRINTER.- LIGHT PRINTING.,I have started using printer and it has been gathered that the refill attached with the machine is used one and giving dim printing. Very strange and direct appropriate person to replace the ink cartridge . Thanks.
EMPOWER EVENTS,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good laser printer.,Printer is good. and Amazon has offered a fantastic deal. disappointed by technical support of HP. couldnt use the wifi command instantly after installation. the technical support helped me installing the USB pattern but failed to set up the wireless operations. awaiting resolution to this. will get back with my feedback on same post a successful completion of installation.
Sudhir Manchanda,3.0 out of 5 stars,Toner needs to be certified to actually print number of pages promised.,"The printer is installed at home and is working well. However the TONER is showing empty though so far I have not even printed 100 pages.
It's something that can't be reported because it takes that much time saved volume to print ace expend the toner."
Arvind Jhunjhunwala,4.0 out of 5 stars,very nice printer to have for home use,Only issue faced is in relation to double side printing which is a big headache as the printer invariably sucks more than one sheet while printing on the reverse side and this renders entire document useless.
Neil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome printer,"Took the advice of a local printer ink refilling dealer, regard this model. No regrets, works beautifully. The most painful thing was getting the right driver software. It took almost one day of searching multiple google links to find the right driver software. The one given in the installation manual is outdated."
jayapriya,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cartiage over after printing about 250 to 300 pages,All are good ...i took only nearly 250 pages caritage is low it showing... actually how many pages it will print when the cartiage full i don't know...??

G.K MISHRA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mindblowing Printer ......... Bole toh pura paisa wasool,"Product performance is superb, constantly using it since 4 months. Printing clarity is also very sharp & nice so everybody should blindly go for it. Also after purchase once you should contact HP ( care centre ) Tollfree number . They will guide you how to install it & if you have net connection then definitely through remote server session they can instantly set all parameters so that never ever you will face any problem about printing scaning through this fabulous printer. Thanks Amazon.in they should allow this seller to business freely because delivery was very speed & above all I am very much satisfied this purchase. I am giving it 10 out of 10 point."
mohd arif,4.0 out of 5 stars,nice product by hp,"printer quality was good,but one thing which was make underline there,that it was not working on inverter supply."
Leslie Pereira,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good,"Had a Inkjet earlier, bought this and Oh my what a difference in performance. Obviously this is a Laserjet. Scanning is superfast and so are the copy and print functions. Best part is the wireless printing and LAN connectivity as i got three computers at home, no need for a primary computer to remain on. Just give a print command from any one of the computers over lan. Scan a document and save it on your phone via WiFi and crop and edit and print it anytime you want. HP AiO app works well with windows phone but i'm not sure why android phones are unable to use the Scan command on their phones. Packaging was not great, a flimsy plastiwrap was used to cover the box. no air cushion bags to protect my printer :(. luckily everything seems fine so far."
Zozo,3.0 out of 5 stars,EPrint - HP Engineers are not even 5th grade pass,"Haha HP!! You American brand. don't even have well qualified field Engineer as well as BPO Engineer. Actually I bought this product 4 days back and then found, I was unable to setup eprint then I call HP Printer customer Care they asked me for Remote Access of my computer and then tried for 1 hour to setp up but without any success and asked me to call in the evening then I called them again... but this time also they had no success. after 2 days they sent a Field Engineer to my place and that young Engineer showed me his medals as he was was chosen ""BEST Engineer"" for last 5 years and as per his claim he was also Senior Field Engineer and relaxed at my place for 1 whole hour with drink and snacks and then put all blame on my internet connection (I have Broadband 2mbps) then I tried myself and to hell with HP and its so called 'engineers' I managed to set up my eprint in half an hour. hahahaha... HP you pay your engineers just to eat snacks at customers' home"
AMIT YADAV,3.0 out of 5 stars,Print quality is ok but wireless installation is horrible . Got only 9 months warranty.,"Amazon/HP fooled me in warranty issue. OVER HP website it shows only 9 months warranty is remaining.

Scanner size is support up to A4 sheet only.

Only thing is the backlight of menu option is not available and not visible in night time, but the menu controller is tilt 90° to 45° to easily visible the text in menu controller."
dhruv,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hp- M126nw, you won't regret it.","If you are searching for a printer for home use and light office use, then this one is a must go. Printer performs up to the mark. The wireless facilities are adorable. You can print through any device or even internet, once your printer is connected to the router.(Don't get worried if it doesn't connects to router, you may need to reset your router, try few times and you will be there)

Though I found this printer a bit pricy in comparison to Samsung(who offers ADF for merely same price) but I won't mind paying for well known branded product."

Avi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect network scanner/printer for small office,"I was looking for a Multi-Function Laser printer for our office that would connect to the network and found this one reviewed decently on Amazon. As with all other things amazon (my experience) the delivery was in perfect condition. CloudTail Retail through whom I have bought a number of items have to also be applauded here. Great packing.

The printer took exactly 5 min to setup and start working via LAN cable. I was unable to connect to the Wireless network but that could also be due to the fact that the WiFi in our office is a bit dodgy. The printer works perfectly over LAN and setting up on Windows and Mac laptops was a real breeze. Highly recommend this for anyone looking at a Printer / Scanner for a small office."

Abhijith Pillai,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worthy printer,"The product makes printing very easy especially when you can print using your phone.

DR. ARIVARASAN.S,4.0 out of 5 stars,Product is ok but could have been better in digital display and easy installation,Good product.

Utkarsh Bhardwaj,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced,"For a printer priced at 16k this does an awful job. Connecting to wifi in a pain, plus there isn't any duplex printing, something that's present even in sub 10k printers, you have to manually print on both sides.
The only plus point is that print quality is good, but I expected a lot more at this price."

pradeep,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good printer very costly toner cartridge,"Nice printer overall, easy to install and use. Print quality awesome too.

The downside is their business model of fleecing money with ink toners, hp cartridge costs around 4500 when outside cartridges cost around 500, it's ok to have 20 or 30% markup but 900% feels like robbery."

But that cartridge could print only about 100 pages. We did not anticipate this. Hence our printing service was affected when cartridge ran out. The manufacturer should clearly indicate how long the free cartridge would last, so that customers can prepare accordingly."

I am in dilemma, whether I have to buy or not.
But seriously this HP laser jet printer is too good, it is affordable in price and gives you Wi-Fi, Air-print easily and fastly. Wherever u sit , it easily print with laptop, Apple AirPrint.
But I face challenges with android phone to connect. It takes time to print, sometimes it cancels.
Overall product is good."

Alan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a true wifi printer, poor quality","Wifi is for direct print/connection only, not to the wifi network. There is no duplex for this, and the latest HP Smart software does not work for this.

Luckily we do not print much, so this printer does the job, but when you look at it, it feels that it was technology from 3-4 generations ago. It's a little expensive for what it is, but seems that when it comes to printers, India does not sell the latest printers/ranges at affordable prices when compared to purchasing in the UK.

During scanning the printer sometimes resets itself, which is a pain when scanning 10+ pages manually and having to restart after the printer resets."
KAMAL BELWAL,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor service,"Very poor customer service
Printing speed slow"
vikram singh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Screen and Wi-Fi issues,Overall it is the best printer for me and you also but it cannot catch Wi-Fi properly and the the screen on it is very bright less you can't even see it with naked eyes you have torch upon it so the only think I get it from that there is a Wi-Fi and screen problem in this printer and all the print quality is best and fast.
krunal parmar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't hesitate to purchase this printer,"I think purchasing this printer is totally worth. It's very useful if you want for your office as well as for home because of it's additional feature like wifi connected. Place it any where and print from your phone and computer which feels good. In one line i can say "" this printer is awesome"""
Pranav Chaudhary,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely good!,"The printer is absolutely hassle free, it supports apple airprint aswell and one can scan documents directly to his phone as well. WiFi setup is a bit tricky and you need to have a WPS router to connect it. Otherwise the printer is very good, fast printing speeds, good scanner and good features like ID copy. Only bad point is does not have backlit display. So its difficult to use this printers features without bright light."
Sandesh Chhatwal,3.0 out of 5 stars,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MAC,"Printer is good . Very difficult to install on wifi . you need to see lot of YouTube videos . For MAC user its almost a headache to instal this printer and Eprint is almost impossible unless you are hardware engineer . There is specific ip address of printer , so every time you have to print you have to select the ip and start the print . Wifi scan will to work on Mac ."
S. Rawal,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the printer, cartridges are costly.","Very useful addition to homes and small businesses. Easy to set up and operate. The connection to existing WiFi networks is easy. Printing from Mobile phones and Tablets is convenient and nifty, once you get the hang of it.
The only drawback i came across is the relatively high cost of ink refills. Around Rs.3000 for a genuine HP cartridge is not exactly economical. -1 star for that.
I would really appreciate the facility of automatic duplex printing. Not a deal-breaker, though."

Pratik Rathod,5.0 out of 5 stars,What you order is what you get!,"As said, what you see is what you get and in this case, what you order is what you get! Great product with great service from Amazon (product, packing and delivery). The printer setup is a breeze and WiFi connectivity couldn't have been easier. The printing process is barely audible and the print is very crisp and clear. Surprisingly the spooling time is drastically reduced as compared to the earlier HP printers that I have used. It supports printing from your PC, laptop, smartphone, tablet and compatible with Android and iOS. I don't think one would ask for more from a printer at this price point for home / home-office use. Money well spent!"
SA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality and versatile,"Wonderful printer, crisp print quality with a nice set of other features. With network printing enabled, it's available from all devices on the local network, although smart phone printing is a bit restrictive, I wish I had more print options. Note that this printer does not do duplex printing, you have to do odd-even pages to achieve that.

Copying is very easy, and scan quality is also very good. Note that scanning odd sized documents is not possible (e.g. some university certificates) as the scanning bed is A4."
akshya,2.0 out of 5 stars,disappointed. i doubt whether it is a new item,"when unboxed, i had only one power cable. when i tried to use, i realise USB cable is required. gave a feedback about absence of usb cable, no response. installation is a big job . has not happened and completed though booked on 9.8.20.

Vijay Sood,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Product for everyday Use!,"When I was planning to buy a printer for my small office, I had various options. There were different companies and different types. I asked a lot of friends and searched online too. But, it added to my confusion. So, lastly, I wrote down my exact requirements and that helped me in narrowing down to this printer. I chose this printer for the following reasons:

1) It is all-In-One printer which supports scan, copy and print
2) It is wireless, so saves me from wiring. I can place it anywhere in the office where there is power supply
3) Easy setup and ease of operation
4) Supports two sides ID printing
5) Prints in bulk, 1 toner can get you around 1500 pages
6) Excellent service support from HP

So, anyone having similar requirements can go for this Printer.

Thanks!"

Varun Sandal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Go for a model upper that this variant. Too high price for this printer.,Struggle to stay connected with your wifi for mobile print. You will have to use Printer`s own wifi direct every time you want to print a document from your mobile device.
Selva Boaz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Printer!!,Printer is very much convenient to use. Eprint and cloud print option is very much useful. Printing speed is Good. Wifi Direct security option is also available so we don't worry about strangers for using the printer. Scanning takes less time when compared with other printers in this range. Printing noise is also low. Only one Cons is display don't have backlight so it's not visible under low lighting conditions.. After that This printer is very much useful for Home and office purposes!!

Sameer,3.0 out of 5 stars,not serves wifi purpose efficient.,"Although it is printing nicely, but main purpose of printing directly from mobile does not serve. U always should have a wifi router between ur mobile and printer. Second thing cartridge given in this printer does not print as many copies as much as 1120 prints,small cartridge cimpare to that printer. Setting up of wifi with router is also not easy."
Gayatri,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok,It is good for printing however scanning quality is not that good.
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not so user friendly,I am giving 3 stars for this printer. Installing this printer was a hurricane task. Setting up this printer in my home office took lot of time. I had to call the HP customer care several times. After trial and error for almost one hour it was installed successfully. Setting up wifi and printing from mobile devices is not easy with this printer. The mobile app too is not user friendly. Can't comment on the cartridge right now. I was using a CANON inkjet printer previously and it was a breeze using it.
Animesh nagdeve,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best,Easy
Rishabh shukla,5.0 out of 5 stars,All in one.,"At a affordable price , this printer is a good deal. It supports multiple functions (scan, copy, print) and it is having wifi connection too. And if u are a Student then it is good for u. All in one."
Sanket,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good printer and totally recommended,"The printer is really good. There is Apple AirPrint support. The print pages are nice and dark. The only problem is to remove the top paper tray handle, we have to lift the scanner cover every time. This is a poor design decision. This happens when you employ engineers to design a product instead of hiring a dedicated designer to do the job.
The scanner performance depends on the app you are using. But it is acceptable.
The printer was installed without any drivers on Windows 10."

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I will recommend it to anyone who needs wifi printing,"One of the best decisions to buy this..i feel i wasted a year by not buying it then and struggling without it. All devices get easily connected, software is superb. Setting it up is slightly nerdy, but once done it works seamlessly. We have Mac and Windows machines in my office. I didn't get the Windows driver CD along, instead got 2 Mac CD's. But, on complaining about it - received it within 3 days by a separate courier. So, all was well there too.
HP customer support was very helpful too."

sp,1.0 out of 5 stars,buy HP at your own risk,"Gave me problems with scanning and copying functions within couple of months of buying the printer. HP support is not very helpful. I am still fighting a battle to repair the printer for the defective functions. Its always risky to buy on line as HP customer care does not recognise HP support warranty dates even after registering with them. In my case i requested for repair of scanning and copying function in Aug 2015 (my first repair request was in Feb 2016 but it was a failure), while the warranty from HP support was till 09 sep 2016. They say warranty is over and the issue is still not resolved. I fail to understand why a printer not even an year old which is used only in home sparingly with good care gives problems before the year is out and on top of that HP support is more of an headache than support. I may have to repair it on my own on payment it seems. Dismayed with HP performance and their support.

If the printer works, then it will be a nice machine to have. I can vouch for that and for that to happen just keep your fingers crossed you get the right one. is It just a coincidence another colleague of mine bought the same machine after me had run into problems? Should not happen with expensive printers but it has happened with me and i feel very distressed."

Bharat,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute misrepresentation/expired product,Brought this a couple of months back. Strongly advise you against it. It is an outdated product.

cons:

2. should have had a dust cover.
Overall a great printer"
Nizamsp,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware! Disappointed!,"Warning: No backlight on the display. On a printer of this price, what's the problem in putting some leds at the back??
Another big warning: No flatbed in scanner. If you have 100 pages to scan, you need to do it one by one. A cheap 3k rupees printer does this.

No return option in Amazon unless there is a technical defect. Make your choice clear before buying. I would have returned it if I was allowed.

Not an good experience on Linux machine. Setup was not easy. I will couldn't connect it wirelessly. Need to run a ethernet from router.

Only Good thing is, it's prints very fast. If you just do printing alone and nothing else, you can consider this."

sony arouje,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Printer,"I bought this Printer recently. It's a good printer for the money. I bought this mainly because of it's wireless capability. Setting up this Printer to connect to my Wireless network was pretty easy, just follow the onscreen instructions in the Installation CD.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,After sales service is VERY POOR. SELL IT AND FORGET IT appears to be the HP tag line.,"HP service is VERY POOR. This printer, is not a plug and play printer. It is impossible to install using the manuals which accompany the printer. One year Warrant covers only remote offsite support. Even after 4 months of purchase, HP could only establish printing and scanning through USB. The basic purpose of purchasing a printer with Wifi Connectivity is LOST, since the feature could not be configured by HP after repeated attempts.
Providing FEEDBACK to HP is also to no avail. They are not proactive and have not ever bothered to check back with the customer based on feedback. DISAPPOINTED with HP service and support.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRINTER. If you do, please do so at your own risk.
Print quality is good. Only One page at a time can be scanned. this is a limitation."

Aman,1.0 out of 5 stars,hp 126nw is not best option in 10k better.,the printer lack wireless app scan you can't scan on mobile app and on computer you can wireless scan and it doesn't have cover lid on the page insert area. this totally annoy thing as charging 10k for the printer. all these features are available in upper model for that hp ask extra money. tonner come half filled. it is better to buy samsung 2071w as it got all features including nfc and available in market for 9500 bucks only. hp being a leader showing arrogance to make people spend more rather providing all features
